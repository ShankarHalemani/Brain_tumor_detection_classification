# Brain Tumor Detection and Classification using Deep Learning Models
<p>

This project focuses on the critical task of detecting and classifying brain tumors using deep learning models. Brain tumors present a significant health concern globally, with timely detection being crucial for improving patient outcomes. The proposed system encompasses several key stages, including data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification.

Deep learning models, specifically AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet-50, GoogLeNet, Xception, and DenseNet-121, were evaluated for their performance in detecting brain tumors. Among these models, DenseNet-121 demonstrated exceptional accuracy, achieving an impressive accuracy of 97.69%. This model outperformed others due to its robust learning and generalization capabilities.

The project utilized a comprehensive dataset consisting of images representing different types of brain tumors, including glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Data preprocessing techniques such as grayscale conversion, denoising, thresholding, and normalization were applied to optimize the images for accurate processing.

Furthermore, data augmentation techniques were employed to artificially expand the training dataset, enhancing the model's ability to learn robust features and generalize well to unseen data.

The experimental setup included parameters such as learning rate, loss function, optimizer, image size, and batch size, which determined the model's performance and efficiency during training and evaluation.

In conclusion, the DenseNet-121 model emerged as the optimal choice for brain tumor detection and classification, offering exceptional accuracy and robust performance. The project holds promise as a valuable screening tool for early detection of brain tumors, potentially improving patient outcomes and survival rates. Future enhancements could involve extending the classification to include other types of brain tumors and developing a user-friendly interface for medical professionals.

This brief explanation encapsulates the essence of the project and can be added to the repository on GitHub to provide an overview for interested users or collaborators.
